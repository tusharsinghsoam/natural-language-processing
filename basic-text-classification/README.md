## Basic Text Classification

1. This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text of the review. This is an example of binary—or two-class—classification, an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem.

2. We'll use the [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/). 

3. These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are *balanced*, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
