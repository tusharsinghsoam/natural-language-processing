# About

- This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with various neural network architectures for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
- We will explore widely used sequential models such as LSTM, RNN, and GRU, applying them to real-world NLP problems like text classification, sentiment analysis, and sequence prediction.
- Dataset sources will be mentioned in the README files of individual projects.
